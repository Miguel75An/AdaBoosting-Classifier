# AdaBoosting-Classifier
Machine Learning: Building an AdaBoosting model using Decision Trees as weak learners. 
The AdaBoosting model is an ensemble method that combines various classifiers into a meta-classifer which covers the weaknesses of each
single classifier. Here we sacrifice computability cost for more precision in classification.
